I look forward to the weakened, to go out with my bike and my group of friends.\"\nAnalysis: The context indicates that the sentence is about the speaker's anticipation for the weekend, therefore \"weakened\" is probably a misspelling and should be corrected to \"weekend\". The comma should also be removed, as the conjunction \"to\" already binds the two sentence parts together.\nCorrected sentence: \"I love this sport. I look forward to the weekend to go out with my bike and my group of friends.\"\n\nInput sentence: \"Lucy Keyes was the last thriller I've seen.\"\nAnalysis: The input sentence implies that the action of watching the movie \"Lucy Keyes\" is ongoing or has relevance to the present, which is not the case. The past simple tense should be used instead of the present perfect tense.\nCorrected sentence: \"Lucy Keyes was the last thriller I saw.\"\n\nInput sentence: \"In the biggest cities around the world the traffic nonstop and increase every day.\"\nAnalysis: 1. A comma was inserted after \"world\". This is required to separate the introductory phrase from the main sentence, improving readability. 2. The word \"is\" was added before \"nonstop\". This was added to ensure verb agreement in the sentence, making sure each subject (traffic) has a corresponding verb (is). 3. Changed \"increase\" to \"increasing\" - \"Increasing\" is the correct form to use after \"is\", to maintain the correct verb tense (present continuous) throughout the sentence. It describes an ongoing action.\nCorrected sentence: \"In the biggest cities around the world, the traffic is nonstop and increasing every day.\"\n\nInput sentence: \"Also, the satisfaction of the customers pushes me to work harder and be better at my job.\"\nAnalysis: The input sentence is grammatically correct, no further corrections required.\nCorrected sentence: \"Also, the satisfaction of the customers pushes me to work harder and be better at my job.\"\n\nInput sentence: \"{text}\" [/INST]\nCorrected sentence: \"",
