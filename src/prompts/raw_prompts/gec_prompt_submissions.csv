Here are some example corrections.

Input sentence: ""I love this sport. I look forward to the weakened, to go out with my bike and my group of friends.""
Analysis: The context indicates that the sentence is about the speaker's anticipation for the weekend, therefore ""weakened"" is probably a misspelling and should be corrected to ""weekend"". The comma should also be removed, as the conjunction ""to"" already binds the two sentence parts together.
Corrected sentence: ""I love this sport. I look forward to the weekend to go out with my bike and my group of friends.""

Input sentence: ""Lucy Keyes was the last thriller I've seen.""
Analysis: The input sentence implies that the action of watching the movie ""Lucy Keyes"" is ongoing or has relevance to the present, which is not the case. The past simple tense should be used instead of the present perfect tense.
Corrected sentence: ""Lucy Keyes was the last thriller I saw.""

Input sentence: ""In the biggest cities around the world the traffic nonstop and increase every day.""
Analysis: 1. A comma was inserted after ""world"". This is required to separate the introductory phrase from the main sentence, improving readability. 2. The word ""is"" was added before ""nonstop"". This was added to ensure verb agreement in the sentence, making sure each subject (traffic) has a corresponding verb (is). 3. Changed ""increase"" to ""increasing"" - ""Increasing"" is the correct form to use after ""is"", to maintain the correct verb tense (present continuous) throughout the sentence. It describes an ongoing action.
Corrected sentence: ""In the biggest cities around the world, the traffic is nonstop and increasing every day.""

Input sentence: ""Also, the satisfaction of the customers pushes me to work harder and be better at my job.""
Analysis: The input sentence is grammatically correct, no further corrections required.

,Andrew Caines,Correct this to standard English:,Zero-shot,,"This is from Yulong Lin's dissertation: he states that it was a starting point, based on the OpenAI prompt for GEC. He also uses the Coyne & Sakaguchi best prompt as another starting point; this has evolved into the Coyne et al one above in row 2","Yulong runs a bunch of prompt tuning experiments, including minor changes to wording and punctuation, also an interesting one on specificity of the instruction (do you have his diss? need to get you a copy if not). In the end he concludes: We see that while increasing specificity increased performance for zero-shot and one-shot learning, the performance boost was not evident when we reached eight examples. This suggests that the number of examples, and potentially the examples chosen, may have much more of an effect on performance than the prompt. -- we can use this as inspiration for focusing on few-shot, and methods for selecting examples."
